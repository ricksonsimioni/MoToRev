## About MoToRev

MoToRev is a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach for developing Tourism Recommender Systems (TRSs). This repository contains the implementation of our novel framework that addresses the key challenges in TRS development:

## Features

- **Hybrid Recommendation**: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
- **EMF Integration**: Works with Eclipse Modeling Framework models
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generates recommendations in CSV, EMF model, and Flexmi formats
- **Customizable Algorithms**: Choose between pure collaborative filtering, hybrid, or content-based approaches
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to support additional recommendation strategies

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.6+
- Eclipse Modeling Tools (for development)
- Apache Mahout 0.14.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ricksonsimioni/MoToRev.git
